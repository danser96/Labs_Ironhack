## Project Description
A comparisson between the information found in the API Art Institue of Chicago and two art blogs. 
The documentation obtained from AICs API covers the pieces of art they have in their exhibit and,
all the artists they have featured. I used this information to compare information about the best
universities for art in USA and the best pieces of art in USA to see if The Art Institute of Chicago
was featured in either blog. 

## Sources
I obtained information from two APIs provided by The Art Institute of Chicago as well as two
blogs from different sources.

## Outcomes
During the comparisson we can observe things like, most common year of art pieces, average year
of art creations, whether the art is popular or not. As well as seeing that AIC is included in 
the best schools for art in the USA.
